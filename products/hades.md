            <p>It visualizes the database related views in a specialized perspective focused on the database 
            administrator tasks. It can be easily deployed on any hosting environment as a Docker container, 
            so that the database inspection and quick changes can be done in a more secure way than exposing 
            the database port itself.</p>
