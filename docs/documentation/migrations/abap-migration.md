# Statement on SAP BW Migration Approach using ABAP

## Legal and Technical Compliance in Data Transformation

At **codbex**, we ensure that our migration solutions adhere to **strict legal and licensing boundaries** when transitioning SAP Business Warehouse (BW) logic to modern, open platforms.  

## 1. What We Do  

### ✅ Permissible Use of SAP BW-Generated ABAP Code  
- We only process ABAP code that is **automatically generated** by SAP BW based on **customer-configured transformations** (e.g., DTPs, mappings)  
- This code is **not manually authored** or derived from SAP proprietary modules  

### ✅ Independent Reimplementation of Logic  
- We transpile (convert) SAP-generated ABAP into **platform-neutral languages** (e.g., JavaScript) **without using SAP runtime components**  
- All external SAP API calls are **replaced with custom implementations**  

### ✅ Data Structure Replication  
- We reconstruct logical data models to ensure **functional equivalence**  
- We **do not copy SAP metadata** or proprietary definitions  

### ✅ Execution Outside SAP Ecosystems  
- Transformed logic runs **entirely in non-SAP environments**  
- **No connection to SAP systems** required post-migration  

## 2. What We Do Not Do  

### ❌ No Use of SAP Proprietary Code  
- We do not embed, distribute, or reference any SAP-owned:  
  - ABAP libraries or runtime components  
  - Patented algorithms or internal logic  

### ❌ No Interaction with SAP Systems  
- Our solution **never calls SAP APIs** or accesses SAP servers  

### ❌ No Usage of SAP-Owned Data  
- All input comes from **previously migrated, licensed datasets**  
- **No extraction of SAP metadata** during migration  

## 3. Legal Safeguards  

### Risk Mitigation  

| Potential Concern | How We Address It |  
|------------------|------------------|  
| SAP claiming ownership of generated ABAP | We rely on **customer-configured logic** |  
| Derivative works claims | We **reimplement functionality** without copying SAP internals |  
| Third-party tooling clauses | We **avoid SAP runtime dependencies** |  

### Open Legal Questions  
Organizations should assess:  
1. Does their SAP license restrict ABAP transpilation?  
2. Are there undisclosed patents affecting logic?  
3. Could output equivalence be misconstrued?  

## 4. Why This Matters  

- **No vendor lock-in** - Migrate freely to modern platforms  
- **Full compliance** - Avoid SAP licensing risks  
- **Business continuity** - Unchanged report semantics  

## 5. Disclaimer  

This reflects codbex's interpretation of permissible practices. **Not legal advice.** Consult counsel for your specific agreements.
