# Manufacturing

## Bill of Materials (BOM)

A Bill of Materials (BOM) is a comprehensive list that outlines the materials, components, and sub-assemblies required to manufacture a finished product.

Key Components:

* Product Structure: Hierarchy of components and sub-assemblies.
* Materials and Quantities: List of raw materials, parts, and quantities needed for each level of assembly.
* Unit of Measure: Measurement units for each material or component.
* Reference Designators: Identification of specific components on the product.

Process:

* The BOM is created during the product design phase.
* It serves as a reference for procurement, production planning, and inventory management.

## Work Order

A Work Order is a document that provides detailed instructions for the production of a specific quantity of a product. It includes information about scheduling, resources, and production timelines.

Key Components:

* Product Details: Name, code, and description of the product being manufactured.
* Quantity to Produce: The number of units to be produced.
* Bill of Materials Reference: Reference to the BOM for the product.
* Work Instructions: Step-by-step instructions for the production process.
* Due Date: The deadline for completing the production.

Process:

* Work Orders are generated based on sales orders or demand forecasts.
* They guide the production team through the manufacturing process and help in resource allocation.

## Routing Sheet

A Routing Sheet, also known as a Routing Card, provides detailed information about the sequence of operations and work centers involved in the manufacturing process.

Key Components:

* Operation Sequence: Step-by-step sequence of operations in the manufacturing process.
* Work Center Details: Information about the work centers or machines involved in each operation.
* Setup and Run Times: Time estimates for setting up and running each operation.
* Tooling and Equipment: Details about tools and equipment needed for each operation.

Process:

* Routing Sheets are created during the production planning phase.
* They guide operators through the production process, helping in efficient scheduling and resource utilization.

## Material Requisition Form

A Material Requisition Form is used to request the procurement of materials needed for the manufacturing process. It helps in maintaining an accurate inventory and ensuring timely availability of materials.

Key Components:

* Material Details: Name, code, and description of the required materials.
* Quantity Needed: The quantity of each material required for production.
* Date Needed: Deadline for when the materials are required.
* Work Order Reference: Reference to the specific work order or production job.

Process:

* Material Requisition Forms are generated based on the materials listed in the BOM.
* They are used to initiate the procurement process and ensure that materials are available when needed.

## Quality Inspection Report

A Quality Inspection Report documents the results of quality control checks conducted during and after the manufacturing process. It ensures that products meet specified quality standards.

Key Components:

* Product Identification: Details about the product being inspected.
* Inspection Criteria: Specifications and standards for quality.
* Inspection Results: Pass/fail status for each quality checkpoint.
* Inspector Details: Information about the person conducting the inspection.

Process:

* Quality Inspection Reports are generated during and after production.
* They are used to identify and address any quality issues, ensuring that only products meeting standards are released.

## Production Log

A Production Log serves as a chronological record of production activities. It provides insights into productivity, downtime, and other key performance indicators.

Key Components:

* Date and Time: Timestamps for each production activity.
* Work Order Reference: Reference to the specific work order or production job.
* Quantity Produced: Number of units produced at each stage.
* Machine or Work Center Details: Information about the machines or work centers used.

Process:

* Production Logs are updated in real-time as manufacturing activities occur.
* They serve as a historical record for analyzing production efficiency and identifying opportunities for improvement.

## Inventory Adjustment Form

An Inventory Adjustment Form is used to record changes in inventory levels due to factors such as production, wastage, or discrepancies. It helps maintain accurate inventory records.

Key Components:

* Product Details: Name, code, and description of the product.
* Adjustment Type: Indication of whether it's an increase or decrease in inventory.
* Quantity Adjusted: The quantity by which the inventory is being adjusted.
* Reason for Adjustment: Explanation of the reason for the adjustment.

Process:

* Inventory Adjustment Forms are used to update inventory levels based on actual production and consumption.
* They help in reconciling physical inventory with system records.

These documents collectively support the manufacturing process, from planning and procurement to production and quality control. They ensure the efficient and accurate production of goods while maintaining quality standards and inventory integrity.
