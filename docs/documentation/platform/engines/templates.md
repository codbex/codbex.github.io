# Templates

## Introduction

The __codbex__ platform supports various template engines, making it easy for developers to generate dynamic content in their applications. This documentation focuses on three popular template engines: Apache Velocity, Mustache, and pure JavaScript templating.

## Template Engines

### Apache Velocity

Apache Velocity is a powerful and flexible template engine that simplifies the generation of dynamic content. The platform's integration with Velocity allows developers to use templates written in the Velocity Template Language (VTL) to produce dynamic output.

### Mustache

Mustache is a logic-less template syntax that can be used for various programming languages. Platform supports Mustache templates, providing a straightforward and consistent way to generate content without introducing complex logic into the templates.

### JavaScript Templating

For developers who prefer using JavaScript for templating, the platform allows the use of pure JavaScript templates. This approach provides the flexibility of using JavaScript functions to generate dynamic content directly.

## Usage Examples

### Velocity Example

```html
## Velocity Template Example
<html>
  <body>
  #set( $foo = "Velocity" )
  Hello $foo World!
  </body>
</html>
```

More about VTL syntax can be found in the [Apache Velocity User Guide](https://velocity.apache.org/engine/1.7/user-guide.html#hello-velocity-world)

### Mustache Template Example

```html
<!-- Mustache Template Example -->
Hello, {{name}}!
```

### JavaScript Template Example

```javascript
// JavaScript Template Example
function generateGreeting(name) {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

// Example Usage
const greeting = generateGreeting("World");
```

## Best Practices

When working with template engines, consider the following best practices:

* Keep templates simple and focused on presentation.
* Separate logic from presentation whenever possible.
* Ensure proper escaping to prevent security vulnerabilities, especially when dealing with user inputs.

## Integration

To use template engines, follow these general steps:

1. Create a Template File: Write your templates using the syntax of the chosen template engine (Velocity, Mustache, or JavaScript).

1. Integrate in Code: Use the platform to integrate the template engine in your code. This may involve loading the template, providing data, and rendering the final output.

1. Testing: Test your templates thoroughly to ensure they generate the expected output. Use the debugging features to identify and fix any issues.

1.Deployment: Deploy your application with the integrated templates to see them in action.

## Conclusion

The __codbex__ platform support for template engines like Apache Velocity, Mustache, and pure JavaScript templating enhances the platform's capabilities for dynamic content generation. Whether you prefer the expressive power of Velocity, the simplicity of Mustache, or the flexibility of JavaScript, it provides a seamless integration experience. Experiment with different template engines based on your preferences and project requirements, and enjoy the efficiency and flexibility they bring to your application development process.
