# TypeScript Engine

## Introduction

The TypeScript Engine in the __codbex__ platform enables developers to write and transpile TypeScript code into JavaScript for server-side scripting. This documentation provides an overview of the TypeScript Engine's features, along with details about the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) and `tsconfig.json` configuration.

## TypeScript Engine Features

### Statically-Typed Development

The TypeScript Engine brings static typing to server-side scripting, enhancing code quality and maintainability. Developers can leverage TypeScript's type annotations and interfaces to catch potential errors during development.

Example:

```typescript
// TypeScript Interface
interface Person {
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
}

// Strongly-typed Function
function greet(person: Person): string {
    return `Hello, ${person.firstName} ${person.lastName}!`;
}
```

### Transpilation to JavaScript

The TypeScript Engine uses the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) to transpile TypeScript code into JavaScript. This process ensures compatibility with the underlying runtime environment and allows developers to benefit from TypeScript's features while executing JavaScript.

Example `tsc` command:

```bash
tsc myfile.ts
```

### `tsconfig.json` Configuration

Developers can configure the TypeScript compilation process using the `tsconfig.json` file. This configuration file allows specifying compiler options, target environments, and other settings.

Example `tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
    "compilerOptions": {
        "target": "ES2020",
        "module": "commonjs",
        "strict": true
    },
    "include": ["src/**/*.ts"],
    "exclude": ["node_modules"]
}
```

In this example, the tsconfig.json file specifies the target ECMAScript version, module system, and strict typing options.

## Conclusion

The TypeScript Engine in the __codbex__ platform, combined with the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) and `tsconfig.json` configuration, provides developers with a powerful environment for building statically-typed server-side applications. Leveraging TypeScript's features, transpilation capabilities, and configuration options, developers can enhance the development and maintenance of their projects.
