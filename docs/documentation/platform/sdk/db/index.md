# Database Module

The Database module provides various APIs to interact with databases, perform SQL operations, and manage data stores. Below are the key components and APIs available in this module:

## [DAO (Data Access Object) API](./dao.md)

The `DAO` API facilitates database operations using an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) approach. It includes methods for executing SQL statements, creating, updating, and deleting entities, as well as handling database tables.
