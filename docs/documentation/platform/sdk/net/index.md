# Net Module

The Net Module provides various APIs for network-related tasks, including communication protocols such as SOAP and WebSocket. These APIs facilitate communication over the network, enabling interaction with remote servers, services, and clients.

## APIs

1. [SOAP API](#soap-api): Exposes a web services framework for manipulating SOAP messages, making calls to external end-points, and creating web services.
2. [WebSocket API](#websocket-api): Provides access to the Session object for the management of bi-directional communication based on the WebSocket specification.

## [SOAP API](soap.md)

The SOAP API enables developers to work with SOAP messages, interact with web services, and make remote procedure calls using the SOAP protocol.

## [WebSocket API](websocket.md)

The WebSocket API offers functionalities for managing WebSocket sessions, sending and receiving messages in real-time, and handling WebSocket events for bi-directional communication.
