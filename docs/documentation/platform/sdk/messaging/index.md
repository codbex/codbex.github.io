# Messaging Module

Welcome to the Messaging Module documentation. This module provides functionality for asynchronous messaging and integration with messaging systems.

## APIs

1. [Message Producer](producer.md): An object for sending text messages to Queue or Topic destinations in the built-in Message Broker.

2. [Message Consumer](consumer.md): An object for receiving and processing text messages from Queue or Topic destinations in the Message Broker.

## Overview

The Messaging Module offers developers tools to facilitate asynchronous communication between different components of an application or between distributed systems. By leveraging message queues and topics, developers can design scalable and loosely coupled architectures that improve reliability, scalability, and maintainability.

## Key Features

- **Asynchronous Communication**: Enable communication between different components or services without blocking the main application flow.

- **Reliable Messaging**: Ensure message delivery and processing even under unreliable network conditions or high message volumes.

- **Scalability**: Build applications that can scale horizontally by distributing workloads across multiple instances or nodes.

- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with message brokers and other messaging systems to enable interoperability between different applications or services.

## Usage

To get started with the Messaging Module, refer to the documentation for each API, which includes usage instructions, examples, and best practices for integrating messaging capabilities into your applications.
