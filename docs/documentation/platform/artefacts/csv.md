During data migration processes, CSV files can be used as an intermediary format to move data from one system to another. This is particularly useful when transitioning between different versions of a system or migrating data to a new platform.

### Batch Processing:

The platform supports batch processing, and CSV files can be a convenient input format for batch jobs. You can create scripts or services that read data from CSV files, perform batch operations, and update databases or other systems accordingly.

### Testing and Development:

In the development and testing phase, CSV files can be utilized to provide test data for applications. Developers can create CSV files containing various data scenarios to test the functionality and performance of their applications.

### Data Sharing Between Applications:

CSV files provide a standardized and lightweight format for sharing data between different applications. This is particularly beneficial when integrating or exchanging data with external systems or services.

### Simple Data Analysis:

For quick data analysis tasks, CSV files can be a convenient choice. You can use spreadsheet software or import CSV files into data analysis tools to perform basic analysis on the contained data.

### Structured Data Input for Scripts:

When developing scripts or services within the platform, CSV files can serve as a structured input source. Scripts can read data from CSV files to perform specific operations, enhancing data processing capabilities.

## Conclusion:

To leverage these use cases, the __codbex__ platform provides APIs and tools for working with CSV files, making it straightforward to read, write, and manipulate data in this popular tabular format.
