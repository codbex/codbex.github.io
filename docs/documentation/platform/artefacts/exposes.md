# Exposes Section in Project (project.json) File

## Overview

The "exposes" section in the Project (`project.json`) file specifies the modules or resources that are exposed to consumers or other parts of the application. It allows developers to define what components or functionalities of the project should be made accessible externally.

## Purpose

The "exposes" section serves several purposes:

1. **Module Exposure**: Developers can use the "exposes" section to specify which modules of the project should be exposed to other parts of the application or external consumers. This includes UI components, APIs, services, libraries, or any other resources that need to be accessed by other modules or applications.

2. **Resource Accessibility**: By defining what modules or resources are exposed, developers can control the visibility and accessibility of various components within the project. This helps in encapsulating implementation details and promoting modular design principles.

3. **Integration Points**: The "exposes" section defines integration points for consuming modules or external applications. It provides a clear indication of what functionalities are available for use and how they can be accessed or consumed.

## Syntax

The syntax of the "exposes" section is a JSON array containing strings representing the names or identifiers of the modules or resources being exposed. Here's a simplified example:

```json
{
  "exposes": [
    "ui",
    "samples"
  ]
}
```

In this example, the project exposes two modules named "ui" and "samples" to other parts of the application or external consumers.

## Usage

The "exposes" section is typically used in the following scenarios:

* **UI Components**: Developers use the "exposes" section to expose UI components, such as pages, widgets, templates, or stylesheets, to be consumed by other parts of the application or external applications.

* **API Endpoints**: The "exposes" section can specify API endpoints or services that are exposed for consumption by other modules or external clients. This includes RESTful APIs, GraphQL endpoints, WebSocket endpoints, or any other types of services.

* **Library Sharing**: Developers can expose libraries, utilities, or helper functions to be shared and reused by other modules within the project or by external applications.

## Conclusion

The "exposes" section in the Project (`project.json`) file allows developers to specify which modules or resources of the project should be exposed for consumption by other parts of the application or external consumers. By defining integration points and resource accessibility, developers can promote modular design, encapsulation, and reusability within their projects.
