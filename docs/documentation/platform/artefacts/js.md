# JavaScript

## Overview:

In the context of the __codbex__ platform, JavaScript files (`*.js` and `*.mjs`) play a crucial role in defining the logic and behavior associated with various artifacts, such as jobs, listeners, websockets, and more. These files contain server-side scripts written in JavaScript, and they are executed within the  runtime environment.

Here's an overview of their usage:

File extensions: `*.js`, `*.mjs`

## Common Characteristics and Usage:

### Server-Side Scripts as RESTful Services

One of the main use cases for JavaScript in the platform is to write server-side scripts that can be exposed as RESTful services. This allows developers to build custom web services that can be easily consumed by external clients, providing a flexible and extensible way to interact with the platform.

Example:

```javascript
import { response } from "sdk/http";

response.println("Hello World!");
```

Example for HTTP RESTful services framework:

```javascript
import { rs } from "sdk/http";

rs.service()
    .resource("")
    .get(function (_ctx, _request, response) {
        response.println("Hello there!");
    })
    .execute();
```

**Benefits:**

* Custom Functionality: JavaScript allows developers to implement custom business logic, data processing, and data retrieval within the RESTful service.
Integration Capabilities:
* RESTful services written in JavaScript can easily integrate with other platform artifacts, such as tables and views, providing a seamless development experience.
* Data Transformation: JavaScript scripts can perform data transformation and enrichment before sending responses to clients.
* Flexible Routing: Developers have the flexibility to define custom endpoints and route requests based on specific requirements.

### Job Handlers:

* For jobs defined in `*.job` files, JavaScript files are used to define the job handler. This script contains the logic to be executed when the job runs.

Example:

```javascript
console.log("Executing custom logic for My Job");
```

### Listener Handlers:

* For listeners defined in `*.listener` files, JavaScript files are used to define the listener handler. This script contains logic to handle events triggered by the listener.

Example:

```javascript
exports.onMessage = function(message) {
	console.log(message);
}

exports.onError = function(error) {
	console.error(error);
}
```

## Best Practices:

### Modularization:

Consider modularizing your JavaScript code for better maintainability and organization, especially when dealing with complex logic.

### Error Handling:

Implement error handling within your JavaScript files to gracefully handle unexpected scenarios.

### Logging:

Use logging statements (e.g., console.log) for debugging and monitoring the execution of your scripts.

### Reuse Code:

Encapsulate reusable logic in functions or modules to promote code reuse.

## Conclusion:

JavaScript files in the platform provide a powerful mechanism to define custom server-side logic associated with various artifacts. They enable developers to extend and customize the behavior of the platform based on specific business requirements.
