# DataSource

## Overview:

The `*.datasource` files in the __codbex__ platform are used to define and configure data sources. These files specify the details required to connect to a database.

Here's an explanation of the example `MyDB.datasource` file and its properties:

```json
{
  "location": "/my-project/datasources/MyDB.datasource",
  "name": "MyDB",
  "driver": "org.h2.Driver",
  "url": "jdbc:h2:file:./target/codbex/h2/MyDB",
  "username": "sa",
  "password": ""
}
```

::: tip
File extension: `*.datasource`
:::

**Properties:**


* `location` (String): Specifies the location or path of the datasource file within the project. In this example, it is located at `/my-project/datasources/MyDB.datasource.`
* `name` (String): Represents the name of the datasource. This is a user-defined name that helps identify and reference the datasource. In this example, it is named `MyDB.`
* `driver` (String): Defines the JDBC driver class for the database or service. In this example, the driver class is "org.h2.Driver," which is commonly used for the H2 database.
* `url` (String): Specifies the JDBC connection URL for accessing the database. The URL format is specific to the database type. In this case, it is `jdbc:h2:file:./target/codbex/h2/MyDB` for an H2 database.
* `username` (String): Provides the username for connecting to the database. In this example, the username is `sa`.
* `password` (String): Represents the password associated with the provided username. In this case, the password is an empty string, but it would typically be populated with the actual password.

## Getting Started:

### Create a Datasource File:

Create a new `*.datasource` file or modify an existing one based on your specific datasource requirements.

### Configure Datasource Properties:

Adjust the properties within the file to match the details of your target database or service. Update the location, name, driver class, URL, username, password, and nature accordingly.

### Use Datasource in Scripts or Services:

Once configured, you can reference the datasource in your project to establish connections to the associated database or service.

## Best Practices:

### Secure Credentials:

If using sensitive information such as passwords, ensure that the `*.datasource` files are appropriately secured. Avoid storing plaintext passwords and consider using secure storage mechanisms.

### Validate Connection:

After configuring a datasource, validate the connection to the associated database or service to ensure that the provided details are correct.

## Conclusion:

The `*.datasource` files in the platform provide a convenient and standardized way to configure and manage connections to databases or external services. Customize these files based on your specific datasource requirements to streamline data access within your applications.
