# View

## Overview:

The *.view files in the __codbex__ platform are used to define and manage database views. Views are virtual tables that represent the result of a stored query. 

Here's an explanation of the example `PERSONS_VIEW.view` file and its properties:

```json
{
    "name": "PERSONS_VIEW",
    "type": "VIEW",
    "query": "SELECT * FROM PERSONS",
    "dependencies": [
        "table:/my-project/tables/PERSONS.table:PERSONS"
    ]
}
```

::: tip
File extension: `*.view`
:::

**Properties:**

* `name` (String): Specifies the name of the view. In this example, it is named `PERSONS_VIEW`.
* `type` (String): Indicates the type of the artifact, and for views, it is set to `VIEW`.
* `query` (String): Contains the SQL query that defines the view. In this example, it is `SELECT * FROM PERSONS`, which retrieves all columns from the `PERSONS` table.
* `dependencies` (Array of Strings): Lists the dependencies of the view. Each dependency is specified in the format `artifactType:artifactLocation:artifactName`. In this example, the view depends on the "PERSONS" table.

## Example Usage:

The example `PERSONS_VIEW.view` file defines a view named `PERSONS_VIEW` that represents the result of the SQL query `SELECT * FROM PERSONS`. It depends on the `PERSONS` table.

## Getting Started:

### Create a View File:

Create a new `*.view` file or modify an existing one based on your specific view requirements.

### Define Query:

Specify the SQL query within the query property to define the content of the view.

### Set Dependencies:

Specify any tables or artifacts on which the view depends within the dependencies array. This ensures that the necessary data is available for the view.

### Use the View:

Once defined, the view can be used in queries and applications as if it were a table, providing a virtual representation of the underlying data.

## Best Practices:

### Clear Naming Conventions:

Follow clear and consistent naming conventions for views to ensure easy identification and reference.

### Optimize Query:

Optimize the SQL query within the query property to retrieve only the necessary columns and rows for efficient performance.

## Conclusion:

The `*.view` files in the platform provide a convenient way to define virtual tables based on SQL queries. Views can be used to simplify complex queries, encapsulate logic, and provide a structured way to access and present data.
