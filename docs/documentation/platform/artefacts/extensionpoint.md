# ExtensionPoint

## Overview:

The `*.extensionpoint` files in __codbex__ platform are used to define extension points within the platform. Extension points allow you to extend and customize the behavior of the system by contributing additional functionality or modifications.

Here's an explanation of the example `myextensionpoint.extensionpoint` file and its properties:

```json
{
  "location": "/my-project/extensions/myextensionpoint.extensionpoint",
  "name": "/my-project/extensions/myextensionpoint",
  "description": "My Extension Point",
  "createdBy": "admin",
  "createdAt": "2022-07-06T2:53:01+0000"
}
```

::: tip
File extension: `*.extensionpoint`
:::

**Properties:**

* `location` (String): Specifies the location or path of the extension point file within the project. In this example, it is located at `/my-project/extensions/myextensionpoint`.
* `name` (String): Represents the unique name or identifier of the extension point. It is used to reference and identify the extension point within the system. In this example, it is named `/my-project/extensions/myextensionpoint.`
* `description` (String): Provides a description of the extension point, describing its purpose or functionality. In this example, the description is `My Extension Point`.
* `createdBy` (String): Indicates the entity or user who created the extension point. In this example, it is marked as `admin`.
`createdAt` (String): Represents the timestamp when the extension point was created. The timestamp follows the **ISO 8601** format. In this example, it is `2022-07-06T2:53:01+0000`.

## Example Usage:

The example `myextensionpoint.extensionpoint` file defines a test extension point within the platform. It is used to extend or customize the behavior of the system based on specific requirements.

## Getting Started:

### Create an Extension Point File:

Create a new *.extensionpoint file or modify an existing one based on your specific extension point requirements.

### Configure Extension Point Properties:

Adjust the properties within the file to match the details of your extension point. Update the location, name, description, createdBy, and createdAt accordingly.

### Implement Extensions:

Once the extension point is defined, you can implement extensions that contribute additional functionality or modifications to the system. Extensions are typically defined in separate artifacts.

## Best Practices:

### Clear Naming Conventions:

Follow clear and consistent naming conventions for extension points to ensure easy identification and reference.

### Document Purpose and Usage:

Provide meaningful descriptions for extension points to document their purpose and intended usage. This helps other developers understand how to leverage or extend the functionality.

## Conclusion:

The `*.extensionpoint` files in the __codbex__ platform serve as a powerful mechanism for extending and customizing the behavior of the platform. Define and configure extension points based on your specific requirements to enable modular and extensible applications.
