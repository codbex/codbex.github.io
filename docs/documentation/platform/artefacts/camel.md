# Apache Camel Routes

## Overview:

The __codbex__ provides support for Apache Camel Routes through the Camel Editor. The Camel Editor allows developers to design and edit Camel routes using graphical tools, making it easier to create and visualize integration solutions.

Here is an overview of the support for Apache Camel Routes files (`*.camel`) in the platform:

File extension: `*.camel`

### Apache Camel Editor:

#### Graphical Design:

The platform built-in Camel Editor provides a graphical interface for designing Camel routes. This allows developers to visually define the flow of integration processes using components provided by Apache Camel.

#### Palette of Components:

The editor includes a palette of Camel components that users can drag and drop onto the canvas. These components represent various integration patterns and actions that can be configured to create complex routes.

#### Property Editors:

Each Camel component on the canvas has a corresponding property editor, enabling developers to configure the behavior of the component. This includes setting parameters, defining endpoints, and specifying data transformations.

#### Code View:

While the graphical editor is the primary interface, the tooling also allows developers to view and edit the underlying Camel route code in XML format. This provides a way to fine-tune configurations or work directly with the XML if preferred.

### Camel Route Files (`*.camel`):

#### File Format:

Apache Camel routes in the __codbex__ platform are typically stored in files with a `.camel` extension. These files contain the XML representation of the Camel routes created using the Camel Editor.

#### Editing and Versioning:

Developers can use the integrated development environment (IDE) to edit and version control their Camel route files. The platform supports collaborative development, allowing multiple developers to work on the same project.

#### Deployment:

Once Camel routes are designed and configured, they can be deployed within the runtime environment. This enables the execution of integration processes defined in the Camel routes.

### Integration with Other Artifacts:

#### Combining with Other Artifacts:

Camel routes can be part of larger __codbex__ platform projects, integrating seamlessly with other artifacts such as scripting services, web pages, and data models. This enables the creation of comprehensive solutions that include both integration and application logic.

### Collaborative Development:

Camel routes, like other artifacts, can be collaboratively developed by multiple team members using the platform's collaborative features. This fosters teamwork and accelerates the development lifecycle.

## Notes

As software evolves, features and capabilities may be enhanced, and it's recommended to refer to the latest documentation or release notes for the most up-to-date information on Apache Camel support.

The Apache Camel artefacts are processed by the [Integrations Engine](../engines/integrations.md).
