# Introduction to Low-Code Development

A low-code development platform (LCDP) revolutionizes software creation by offering a development environment that relies on graphical user interfaces and configuration instead of traditional hand-coded computer programming. This approach allows developers of varying experience levels to craft applications using a visual interface combined with model-driven logic.

## Our Insights

Drawing from our extensive background as developers, product owners, architects, and software vendors, working with clients ranging from SMEs to large enterprises, we've observed several key challenges:

1. Traditional application development entails significant effort.
2. The pace of developing and delivering business applications is sluggish.
3. Extending business applications and processes presents notable challenges.

The consequences include amplified setup and training costs, elevated development and deployment costs, increased maintenance and upgrade expenses, and heightened barriers to cloud adoption. Despite these hurdles, companies aspire to innovate swiftly and efficiently.

## The Current Pain Points

Presently, businesses encounter the following pain points:

1. Time to market is protracted, often surpassing 9-12 months per business application.
2. Traditional hand-coded software is not immune to bugs, necessitating ongoing support with a cost ratio of up to 7x compared to development costs.
3. Even professional developers face prolonged onboarding periods and struggle to be productive in cloud environments.

## The Challenge

How do we diminish the reliance on traditional hand coding, expedite the delivery of business applications, and simultaneously reduce setup, training, deployment, and maintenance costs?

## The Solution

We propose constructing a technology platform tailored to Line of Business (LoB) users who require low-code platforms and tools for "domain experts" and/or "citizen developers." This platform will enable users to design and build solutions that seamlessly integrate and extend with other systems, thereby minimizing the learning curve required to commence development and extend existing systems.

## In the News

Gartner predicts that by 2024, low-code application development will drive over 65% of application development activity. Furthermore, three-quarters of large enterprises are anticipated to utilize at least four low-code development tools by 2024.

## Market Trends

- Market size: Expected to reach $46.4 billion by 2026, growing at a CAGR of 25%.
- $3.8 billion in 2017.
- $21.2 billion by 2022.
- Predicted market size of $46.4 billion by 2026 with a 25% CAGR.
- By 2024, 75% of large enterprises will utilize at least four Low-Code Application Platforms (LCAP).
- By 2024, 65% of all application development will occur in LCAP.

## Current Impact

We've engaged with over 250 users and individual contributors in the context of low-code development and high-productivity tooling. Feedback has been positive, with users expressing eagerness to utilize high-productivity tools that lower the barrier to cloud entry.
