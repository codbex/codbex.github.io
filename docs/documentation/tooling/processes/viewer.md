# Process Viewer

The "Processes Workspace" perspective in the __codbex__ platform provides a dedicated environment for managing and monitoring BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) based runtime processes. This perspective offers tools to visualize, analyze, and control business processes efficiently. This section covers the "Process Viewer", an essential component that allows users to graphically view BPMN process definitions and instances, highlighting the current step of the process.

## Accessing the Processes Workspace Perspective

1. **Navigate to the Processes Workspace Perspective:**
   - Access the Processes Workspace Perspective in the platform.

2. **Open the Process Viewer:**
   - Within the Processes Workspace perspective, open the "Process Viewer". This graphical representation provides an overview of BPMN process definitions and instances.

## Process Viewer

### 1. **Graphical Representation of Process Definitions:**
   - The Process Viewer displays BPMN process definitions graphically, allowing users to visualize the structure and flow of each defined process. This representation includes elements such as tasks, gateways, events, and connections.

### 2. **Dynamic Highlighting of Current Step:**
   - Experience dynamic highlighting of the current step or active node within running BPMN process instances. This feature provides real-time visibility into the progress of each instance.

### 3. **Process Instance Overview:**
   - View a comprehensive overview of all active BPMN process instances. Each instance is represented graphically, allowing users to quickly identify the stage of execution and the active tasks within the process.

### 4. **Detailed Process Information:**
   - Access detailed information about each process definition, including key identifiers, version information, and contextual metadata. This information is valuable for understanding the characteristics of each defined process.

## Advanced Functionality

1. **Interactive Process Exploration:**
   - Interact with the Process Viewer to explore different aspects of BPMN process definitions and instances. Zoom in, zoom out, and pan through the graphical representation for a detailed view.

2. **Integration with Process Instances View:**
   - Seamlessly transition between the Process Viewer and the Process Instances View for a holistic understanding of both process definitions and active instances. This integration enhances the monitoring capabilities.

3. **Real-time Updates:**
   - Experience real-time updates to the graphical representation as process instances progress. Dynamic updates ensure that the displayed information accurately reflects the current state of each instance.

## Conclusion

The "Processes Workspace" perspective in the platform, with the "Process Viewer", provides a powerful tool for graphically visualizing BPMN process definitions and instances. Whether exploring process structures, monitoring active instances, or dynamically highlighting the progress of execution, this feature enhances the overall understanding and control of business processes.
