# Process Instances

Continuing with the "Processes Workspace" perspective in the __codbex__ platform, the "Process Instances" view offers insights into the runtime execution of BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) processes. This view provides real-time monitoring tools to track and analyze active process instances. Let's explore the key features of the "Process Instances" view.

## Accessing the Processes Workspace Perspective

1. **Navigate to the Processes Workspace Perspective:**
   - Access the Processes Workspace Perspective in the platform.

2. **Open the Process Instances View:**
   - Within the Processes Workspace Perspective, open the "Process Instances" view. This view displays a list of currently active BPMN process instances.

## Features

### 1. **Real-Time Process Instance Monitoring:**
   - The Process Instances View provides a real-time overview of active BPMN process instances. Track the progress, status, and key details of each running instance.

### 2. **Instance Status Indicators:**
   - Each process instance entry is accompanied by status indicators, providing quick insights into whether the instance is running, completed, or in an error state.

### 3. **Process Instance Details:**
   - Access detailed information about each process instance, including instance ID, start time, end time (if completed), and relevant metadata. This information aids in understanding the lifecycle of each instance.

### 4. **User and System Task Tracking:**
   - Monitor user and system tasks associated with each process instance. Track the progression of tasks and identify any bottlenecks or delays in the process flow.

### 5. **Instance Filtering and Sorting:**
   - Utilize filtering and sorting options to focus on specific subsets of process instances. Filter by process definition, status, or other criteria to streamline monitoring.

## Retry Functionality

### 1. **Retry Process Instances:**
   - The "Retry" functionality allows users to initiate a retry for a failed or terminated process instance. This is particularly useful for addressing issues or errors encountered during the initial execution.

### 2. **Configurable Retry Options:**
   - Users can configure retry options, including the number of retry attempts, delay between retries, and other relevant parameters. This flexibility enhances the control over the retry process.

### 3. **Monitoring Retried Instances:**
   - Track and monitor instances that have undergone the retry process. Gain insights into the success or failure of retried instances, facilitating continuous improvement in process execution.

## Skip Functionality

### 1. **Skip Process Instances:**
   - The "Skip" functionality allows users to skip specific tasks or steps within a running process instance. This is useful for bypassing errors or addressing situations where manual intervention is not required.

### 2. **Selective Skipping:**
   - Users can selectively choose which tasks or steps to skip within a process instance. This fine-grained control ensures that only the necessary elements are skipped, preserving the integrity of the process.

### 3. **Audit Trail for Skipped Steps:**
   - Maintain an audit trail for skipped steps, documenting the decisions and actions taken during the skipping process. This information aids in transparency and accountability.

## Advanced Functionality

1. **Interactive Process Instance Visualization:**
   - Visualize the flow and status of a specific process instance through an integrated BPMN diagram. This provides a graphical representation of the active process.

2. **Task Details and Interaction:**
   - Drill down into the details of individual tasks within a process instance. View task details, such as assignees and due dates, and interact with tasks directly from the Process Instances View.

3. **Instance Termination and Suspension:**
   - Take control of process instances by suspending or terminating them directly from the view. This allows for proactive management and intervention in case of issues or changes in requirements.

## Conclusion

The "Process Instances" view in the platform enhances the monitoring capabilities of BPMN-based processes by providing real-time insights into active instances. Whether tracking instance status, analyzing task progression, or interacting with running instances, this view empowers users to manage and optimize process execution.
