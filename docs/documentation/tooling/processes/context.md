# Process Context

The "Processes Workspace" perspective in the platform provides a dedicated environment for managing and monitoring BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) based runtime processes. This perspective offers tools to visualize, analyze, and control business processes efficiently. This section covers the "Process Context" view, a key component that allows users to inspect and manage the contextual data associated with individual BPMN process instances.

## Accessing the Processes Workspace Perspective

1. **Navigate to the Processes Workspace Perspective:**
   - Access the Processes Workspace Perspective in the platform.

2. **Open the Process Context View:**
   - Within the Processes Workspace Perspective, open the "Process Context" view. This view displays the contextual data associated with active BPMN process instances.

## Process Context View

### 1. **Instance Context Information:**
   - The Process Context view provides detailed information about the context of each active BPMN process instance. This includes variables, data objects, and other contextual information associated with the running instance.

### 2. **Variable Listing:**
   - View a list of variables and their current values within the selected process instance. This information is crucial for understanding the state and progression of the process.

### 3. **Data Object Inspection:**
   - Inspect data objects associated with the process instance. The view allows users to explore the content and structure of data objects, aiding in debugging and analysis.

### 4. **Contextual Metadata:**
   - Access metadata information related to the context of a process instance. This may include details such as the creation time, author, and other relevant information.

## Advanced Functionality

1. **Context Modification:**
   - Modify variables and data objects within the context of a running process instance. This functionality enables users to update and manipulate contextual data during the execution of a process.

2. **Real-time Context Updates:**
   - Experience real-time updates to the process context view as variables and data objects change during the execution of the BPMN process. This feature provides a dynamic and interactive view of the process state.

3. **Integration with BPMN Editor:**
   - Seamlessly transition from the Process Context view to an integrated BPMN editor for direct editing and modification of BPMN process definitions based on the observed context.

## Conclusion

The "Processes Workspace" perspective in the platform, with the "Process Context" view, offers a powerful toolset for inspecting and managing the contextual data associated with active BPMN process instances. Whether analyzing variables, inspecting data objects, or modifying the context in real-time, this view enhances the understanding and control of process execution.
