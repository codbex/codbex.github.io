# Process Definitions

The "Processes Workspace" perspective in the __codbex__ platform offers a dedicated environment for managing and monitoring BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) based runtime processes. This perspective provides a set of tools to visualize, analyze, and control business processes efficiently. This section covers the "Process Definitions" view, a key component of the Processes Workspace perspective.

## Accessing the Processes Workspace Perspective

1. **Navigate to the Processes Workspace Perspective:**
   - Access the Processes Workspace perspective in the platform.

2. **Open the Process Definitions View:**
   - Within the Processes Workspace Perspective, open the "Process Definitions" view. This view displays a list of available BPMN process definitions.

## Features

### 1. **Process Definition Listing:**
   - The Process Definitions View presents a list of available BPMN process definitions within the connected runtime environment. Each entry includes details such as process name, version, and key identifiers.

### 2. **Version Management:**
   - Easily manage different versions of BPMN process definitions. The view allows users to track, compare, and analyze changes between various versions of a process.

### 3. **Visual Representation:**
   - Gain insights into the structure of BPMN process definitions through visual representations. The view may include BPMN diagrams or graphical representations of process flows.

### 4. **Process Details:**
   - Access detailed information about each process definition, including its key, version, author, and relevant metadata. This information aids in understanding the characteristics and history of a process.

### 5. **Process Versioning:**
   - Navigate between different versions of a process definition. The view provides tools for selecting and exploring specific versions of a process.

## Advanced Functionality

1. **Integrated BPMN Editor:**
   - Seamlessly transition from the Process Definitions View to an integrated BPMN editor for detailed editing and modification of process definitions.

2. **Process Metrics and Analytics:**
   - Access real-time metrics and analytics related to each process definition. Monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) and other relevant data to assess process efficiency.

3. **Process Deployment:**
   - Deploy and manage the deployment of BPMN process definitions to the runtime environment directly from the Processes Workspace Perspective.

## Conclusion

The "Processes Workspace" perspective in the platform, with the "Process Definitions" view, provides a comprehensive toolset for managing BPMN-based runtime processes. Whether exploring process details, analyzing versions, or deploying changes, this perspective streamlines BPMN process management workflows.
