# Operations

The Operations perspective provides tools and views for inspecting and managing the runtime aspects of deployed application content in the system registry. It offers insights into various operational aspects such as published application content, configurations, loggers, extension points, extensions, deployed artefacts, and their state.

## Views and Functionality

### 1. Published Application Content

The Registry view displays a list of currently published application content in the system registry. It provides information about the published content name, version, deployment status, and other relevant details. Users can inspect the published content and perform operations such as starting, stopping, or redeploying applications.

### 2. Configurations

The Configurations view allows users to view and manage configurations for deployed application content. It provides a centralized location to inspect configuration settings, properties, and values. Users can modify configurations as needed and apply changes to the runtime environment.

### 3. Loggers Configurations

The Loggers Configurations view enables users to manage logging configurations for deployed application content. It allows users to specify logging levels, appenders, and other logging settings for different loggers within the application. Users can dynamically adjust logging configurations to control the verbosity and output of log messages.

### 4. Extension Points and Extensions

The Extension Points and Extensions view provides insights into the extension points defined in the system and their associated extensions. Users can explore available extension points, view registered extensions, and manage extension configurations. This view facilitates extensibility and customization of the system by allowing users to add or remove extensions as needed.

### 5. Deployed Artefacts and State

The Deployed Artefacts and State view offers visibility into the artefacts deployed in the system and their current state. It lists deployed artefacts such as tables, views, jobs, listeners, templates, configurations, and other resources, along with their deployment status and health indicators. Users can monitor the status of deployed artefacts and take corrective actions if needed.

## Benefits

- **Visibility**: Provides a comprehensive overview of the operational aspects of deployed application content and configurations.
  
- **Control**: Enables users to inspect, manage, and control various runtime aspects of the system, such as logging configurations and deployed artefacts.
  
- **Troubleshooting**: Facilitates troubleshooting and diagnostics by offering insights into the state and health of deployed application content and artefacts.

## Conclusion

The Operations perspective serves as a central hub for monitoring and managing the runtime aspects of deployed application content in the system registry. It empowers users to maintain system health, optimize performance, and ensure smooth operation of the platform.
