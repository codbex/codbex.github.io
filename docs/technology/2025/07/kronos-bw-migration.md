# Migrating SAP BW with Kronos – Technical Guide

## Overview

In this blog post, we present a technical deep dive into migrating SAP BW scenarios using Kronos — codbex’s modern data integration platform — onto modern platforms like Snowflake, SAP HANA, and even lightweight setups like H2 for local testing. For a broader, business-focused perspective on this migration journey, check out our companion post: [Migrating SAP BW with Kronos - From Legacy to Flexibility](https://www.codbex.com/marketing/2025/06/10/kronos-bw-migration)

## Migration Summary
SAP BW systems, while historically robust, are built on tightly-coupled ABAP logic and rigid data models. Migrating to Kronos allows you to retain your BW logic while adopting modern, flexible, and cloud-native data platforms. Using Kronos, you can:

- Export and reimplement BW transformation logic.
- Replicate BW data models (InfoObjects, DataSources, DSOs, InfoCubes, MultiProviders).
- Rebuild data model flows logic with BPM orchestration.
- Visualize the result using modern tools.
- Run on Snowflake, HANA, PostgreSQL or even H2 for local testing.

The Kronos allows this entire process to be modular, reusable, and executable on any supported platform.

## Lift-and-Shift Migration Approach
The "lift and shift" strategy provides a straightforward and transparent method to migrate your SAP BW logic with minimal redesign. The following steps outline the process using Kronos:

1. Replicate BW Objects to Target Platform

   All BW objects (InfoObjects, DataSources, DSOs, InfoCubes, etc.) are copied over to the destination platform. This can be done using any data migration tools.

   </a>

1. Migrate Data

   Once the data structures are in place, all associated data must also be migrated to ensure full alignment with the original BW system. This step guarantees a one-to-one semantic correspondence between the source and target environments.

1. Export BW Transformation Logic
   
   Each ABAP transformation is completely exported from the BW system using a dedicated export tool.
   
   The exported artifacts must be pushed to a Kronos project stored in a git repository.

   </a>

1. ABAP Transformation code to JavaScript code
   
   On build time, the ABAP transformation code is automatically transpiled to JavaScript. This allows Kronos to execute it during the transformation.

   </a>
   
1. Rebuild Transformations as ETL Camel Routes

   Using Kronos ETL modules based on Apache Camel, each transformation is re-implemented as a Camel route.

   </a>

1. BW Data Model Flows as BPM Processes
   
   Each data model flow is implemented as Kronos BPM process:
   - Each BPM task calls an ETL Camel route
   - Aggregated results are stored
   - Fully orchestrated execution flow mirrors BW’s data model flow behavior

   </a>

1. Visualization

   Once all BPM processes have been executed and the underlying ETL transformations have run successfully, the data is ready for visualization. At this stage, you can:
   - Connect to modern BI tools like Tableau, Power BI, or Apache Superset
   - Recreate classic BEx Queries using Kronos or redesign reports with a modern UX
   - Enable self-service analytics and dynamic dashboards powered by the transformed, consolidated data

   </a>

1. Decommission the BW System

   Once all data structures, transformations, and reporting flows have been successfully migrated and validated within Kronos, the legacy SAP BW system can be safely decommissioned. This marks the completion of the migration, allowing you to reduce infrastructure costs and eliminate technical debt associated with maintaining the older BW environment.

## Demo: Bike Sales MultiProvider Migration 

**TODO**

As a practical showcase, we provide a demo migration project of a BW scenario for Bike Sales, consisting of:

- DataSources: Product Master, Sales Orders, Customer Info
- DSOs: Sales Order Header/Items, Inventory
- Cubes: Aggregated Sales Data
- MultiProvider: Consolidated Bike Sales Overview

Each layer is implemented with Kronos components and runs on any supported backend. The project includes:
- Schema definitions for Snowflake/PostgreSQL
- Sample ETL Camel Routes
- BPM Orchestration
- Sample dashboards and reports
