# Onboarding Process Tutorial 3: SMTP Connection

## Introduction

In the era of automation and seamless communication, integrating messaging capabilities into business processes is more essential than ever. **Hyperion Edition** takes this a step further by enabling users to automate email workflows directly within BPMN models. By configuring **SMTP connection**, users can configure automated email sending as part of any process, whether itâ€™s sending confirmations, alerts, or reports. This feature eliminates the need for external tools, allowing emails to be triggered dynamically based on process logic â€” all within a fully No-Code environment.

## SendGrid Configuration

Twilio SendGrid's SMTP Relay feature enables you to send emails with your personal gmail account. That's the service that will be used for the purposes of this tutorial.

### Verifying a Single Sender

-   Create a SendGrid account at [https://sendgrid.com](https://sendgrid.com).
-   Login at [https://app.sendgrid.com](https://app.sendgrid.com/).
-   Click **Settings** â†’ **Sender Authentication** â†’ **Verify a Single Sender**.
-   Enter the details of the email address that will send all automated mails.

### Setup SMTP Relay

-   Click **Email API** â†’ **Integration Guide** â†’ **SMTP Relay**.
-   Enter an API Key Name and click **Create Key** to get an API Key for your SendGrid SMTP Relay.
-   Notice the **Configure your application** section, the credentials from it will be used to configure the mail client.

## Hyperion Configuration

For **Hyperion** to connect to **SendGrids' Service** it needs some **Environment Variables**. Full list of them can be found in the [Environment Variables](https://www.dirigible.io/help/setup/setup-environment-variables/) section.

These are the needed **envs**:
```
DIRIGIBLE_MAIL_USERNAME=apikey
DIRIGIBLE_MAIL_PASSWORD=<YOUR_API_KEY_HERE>
DIRIGIBLE_MAIL_TRANSPORT_PROTOCOL=smtp
DIRIGIBLE_MAIL_SMTP_HOST=smtp.sendgrid.net
DIRIGIBLE_MAIL_SMTP_PORT=587
DIRIGIBLE_MAIL_SMTP_AUTH=true
ONBOARDING_EMAIL=<YOUR_VERIFIED_SENDGRID_EMAIL>
```
These **envs** must be added to the **starting command** of **Hyperion**. For **Docker image start** it will look like this:

```
docker run --name hyperion \
-p 80:80 \
-e DIRIGIBLE_MAIL_USERNAME=apikey \
-e DIRIGIBLE_MAIL_PASSWORD=<YOUR_API_KEY_HERE> \
-e DIRIGIBLE_MAIL_TRANSPORT_PROTOCOL=smtp \
-e DIRIGIBLE_MAIL_SMTP_HOST=smtp.sendgrid.net \
-e DIRIGIBLE_MAIL_SMTP_PORT=587 \
-e DIRIGIBLE_MAIL_SMTP_AUTH=true \
-e ONBOARDING_EMAIL=<YOUR_VERIFIED_SENDGRID_EMAIL> \
ghcr.io/codbex/codbex-hyperion:latest
```

## Onboarding Announcement Service Task

Now that **Hyperion** is prepared to use **SendGrids SMTP services** we can implement email automation in the process.

### Creating Service Task

- Open the **BPMN** file
- From **Activities** grab a **Service Task** and place it in the diagram space
- Connect the **Document Generation** task to the new one
- The new one connect to the end event

![new service task](../../../../images/2025-05-07-onboarding-process/new-service-task-setup.gif)

- Click on the new task to open its properties
- In the **Id** field type **`onboarding-announcement`**
- In the **Name** field type **`Onboarding Announcement`**
- In the **Delegate Expression** field type **`${JSTask}`**
- Click on the **Class** field â†’ the **+** button to add handler entry
- In the **Name** field type **`handler`**
- In the **String value** field type the link to the task definition **`codbex-sample-hyperion-employee-onboarding/tasks/onboarding-announcement.ts`**

![onboarding announcement](../../../../images/2025-05-07-onboarding-process/onboarding-announcement-task-configuration.gif)

### Mail Util

Throughout the process many services will be sending automated emails. To avoid code repetition a simple mail utility file can be created.

- In the tasks folder create a file called **`mail-util.ts`**
- In the new file paste the following code:

<details>
  <summary>ðŸ“„ View code</summary>

```typescript
import { configurations } from  "sdk/core";
import { logging } from  "sdk/log";
import { client as mailClient } from  "sdk/mail";

const logger = logging.getLogger("mail-util.ts");

function isMailConfigured() {
	return configurations.get("DIRIGIBLE_MAIL_USERNAME") &&
    	configurations.get("DIRIGIBLE_MAIL_PASSWORD") &&
    	configurations.get("DIRIGIBLE_MAIL_TRANSPORT_PROTOCOL") &&
    	(
        	(configurations.get("DIRIGIBLE_MAIL_SMTPS_HOST") && configurations.get("DIRIGIBLE_MAIL_SMTPS_PORT") && configurations.get("DIRIGIBLE_MAIL_SMTPS_AUTH"))
        	||
        	(configurations.get("DIRIGIBLE_MAIL_SMTP_HOST") && configurations.get("DIRIGIBLE_MAIL_SMTP_PORT") && configurations.get("DIRIGIBLE_MAIL_SMTP_AUTH"))
    	);

}

export  function sendMail(reciever: string, subject: string, content: string) {

const sender = configurations.get("ONBOARDING_EMAIL");

if (isMailConfigured()) {
	logger.info("Sending mail to [{}] with subject [{}] and content: [{}]...", reciever, subject, content);
	mailClient.send(sender, reciever, subject, content, 'html');
} else {
	logger.error(`Mail to: ${reciever} with subject: ${subject} and content: ${content} will NOT be send because the mail client is not configured!`);
	throw  new  Error(`Mail to: ${reciever} with subject: ${subject} and content: ${content} will NOT be send because the mail client is not configured!`);
	}
}

```

> ðŸ’¡ **Note**  
> This code defines the **utility to send emails** in **Hyperion** by first checking if the **mail client** is properly configured using the required **environment variables** (username, password, protocol, and SMTP/SMTPS details). If configuration is valid, it logs the action and sends an **HTML email** using the **inner mail library**; otherwise, it logs and throws an error indicating the email could not be sent due to **missing configuration**.

### Onboarding Announcement Definition

- In the tasks folder create a file called **`onboarding-announcement.ts`**
- Paste the following code in the file:

<details>
  <summary>ðŸ“„ View code</summary>

```typescript
import { EmployeeRepository  as  EmployeeDao } from  "codbex-sample-hyperion-employee-onboarding/gen/codbex-sample-hyperion-employee-onboarding/dao/Employee/EmployeeRepository";
import { DepartmentRepository  as  DepartmentDao } from  "codbex-sample-hyperion-employee-onboarding/gen/codbex-sample-hyperion-employee-onboarding/dao/Department/DepartmentRepository";

import { process } from  "sdk/bpm";
import { sendMail } from  "./mail-util";

const employeeDao = new  EmployeeDao();
const departmentDao = new  DepartmentDao();

const execution = process.getExecutionContext();
const executionId = execution.getId();

const managerId = process.getVariable(executionId, "Manager");
let managerLink = process.getVariable(executionId, "ManagerLink");
const employeeId = process.getVariable(executionId, "Employee");

const manager = employeeDao.findById(managerId);
if (!manager) {
throw  new  Error(`Employee with ID ${managerId} not found!`);
}

const employee = employeeDao.findById(employeeId);
if (!employee) {
throw  new  Error(`Employee with ID ${employeeId} not found!`);
}

const departmentName = departmentDao.findById(employee.Department).Name;

const subject = "Employee Onboarding Review";
const processInstanceId = execution.getProcessInstanceId();

managerLink = `${managerLink}&processId=${processInstanceId}`;

sendMail(manager.Email, subject, content);

```

> ðŸ’¡ **Note**  
> This script  retrieves the manager, employee, and department details from the database using their respective DAOs, constructs a personalized HTML email prompting the manager to review and assign onboarding tasks, and sends the email using a mail utility. It ensures the necessary data is present, generates a dynamic link to the onboarding process, and includes professional formatting to guide the manager's next steps.
The manager form will be created in the next tutorial

## Test BPMN Process

Now if the process is activated in the same manner as in the previous tutorial a mail should be sent to the email of the manager, who in our case is the first entered employee (the HR).
