# Onboarding Process Tutorial 6: Completing Onboarding Process

## Introduction

From triggering email notifications through **SMTP** service tasks, to assigning **User Tasks** for collecting inputs or approvals, and guiding flow with intelligent **Logical Gateways**, every step is seamlessly modeled. Modular design with **Subprocesses** executed in parallel keeps the process clean and adaptable, while **BPMN** ensures visual transparency and standardization across teams. The result is a robust onboarding workflow that combines automation with human interaction, decision logic, and scalabilityâ€”all built visually, with no code. With **Hyperion**, organizations can deliver faster, smarter onboarding experiences that evolve effortlessly with business needs.

To complete the onoarding process the HR initiator must review the tasks that have been done. That implies that when they are done an email should be send to notify. After the HR approval the news should be announced to the new employee. So there are three more tasks left to do.

## Task Completion Announcement

### Service task configuration

- Open the **BPMN** file
- From **Activities** grab a **Service Task** and place it in the diagram space
- Connect the **subprocess** to the new task
- Click on the new task to open its properties
- In the **Id** field type **`task-completion-announcement`**
- In the **Name** field type **`Task Completion Announcement`**
- In the **Delegate Expression** field type **`${JSTask}`**
- Click on the **Class** field â†’ the **+** button to add handler entry
- In the **Name** field type **`handler`**
- In the **String value** field type the link to the task definition **`codbex-sample-hyperion-employee-onboarding/tasks/task-completion-announcement.ts`**

![task-completion-announcement](../../../../images/2025-05-07-onboarding-process/task-completion-announcement.gif)

### Service task definition

- In the tasks folder create a file called **`task-completion-announcement.ts`**
- Paste the following code in the file

sendMail(onboardingInitiator.Email, subject, content);

```

</details>

> ðŸ’¡ **Note**  
> This script sends a final review email to the onboarding initiator once all assigned onboarding tasks for a new hire have been completed. It gathers relevant details such as the initiator, new employee, department, and process instance from the BPM context and repositories, then generates a styled HTML email containing a call-to-action link for approval. The email is dispatched using a mail utility to prompt the initiator to complete the final onboarding step.

## Onboarding Completion Review

### User task configuration

-   Open the **BPMN** file
-	From **Activities** grab an **User Task** and place it in the diagram space
-	Connect the **Task Completion Announcement** task to the new one
-	Click on the user task to open its properties
-	In the **Id** field type **`onboarding-completion-review`**
-	In the **Name** field type **`Onboarding Completion Review`**

![onboarding completion review](../../../../images/2025-05-07-onboarding-process/onboarding-completion-review.gif)

### HR Confirmation form

Follow these steps to create the necessary folder structure and file:

1. Inside the **`forms`** folder, create another folder named **`HRConfirmation`**.

2. Within the **`forms`** folder, create a new file named **`hr-confirmation-form.html`** and place the required code inside it.

```
angular.module('templateApp', ['blimpKit', 'platformView']).controller('templateController', ($scope, $http) => {

    $scope.entity = {};
    $scope.forms = {

> ðŸ’¡ **Note**

4. Inside the `forms` folder, create a new folder named **`api`**, then create a file called **`HRConfirmationFormService.ts`** within it. Place the following code inside this file:

## Test final BPMN process

- Go to the **Dashboard** of the application at http://localhost/services/web/dashboard/ â†’ Click the **New Hire Navigation**
- Enter the details of the new hire
- After some time the tasks of the onboarding process will be created. To view them go to the **Dashboard** of the application at http://localhost/services/web/dashboard/ â†’ Click the **Onboarding Tasks Navigation**
- Check the email of the manager and click on the button from there
- If you check the **Process Workspace** you'll see that the process has stop at the user task and waits for it to be completed
- After that complete the **form** by assigning employees to the tasks.
- All the employees should recieve an email
- If you check the **Process Workspace** you'll see that the process has stop at the subprocess
- Now click on the button from a mail send to an assignee to open the form and complete the task
- After completing the onboarding task a mail should be sent to the email of the process initiator - the initial HR

![initiator mail](../../../../images/2025-05-07-onboarding-process/initiator-mail.png)

- If you check the **Process Workspace** you'll see that the process has stop at the **Onboarding Completion Review** task

![process waiting initiator](../../../../images/2025-05-07-onboarding-process/process-waiting-initiator.png)

- Complete the form to continue with the process
