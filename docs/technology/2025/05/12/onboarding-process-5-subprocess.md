# Onboarding Process Tutorial 5: Configuring-Subprocess

## Introduction

As business processes grow more complex, the need for modular and scalable workflow design becomes essential. **Hyperion Edition** meets this challenge with its support for **Subprocesses in BPMN**, allowing users to group related tasks into self-contained units for better organization and reuse. These subprocesses can be configured for **parallel** or **sequential** execution, giving users full control over how tasks are handled within each block. Whether tasks need to run simultaneously to save time or in a strict order to maintain dependencies, this flexibility ensures that processes are both efficient and logically sound.

## Subprocess

To incorporate the onboarding task created by the first service - **Document Generation**, a subprocess can be used. It will notify the assignees via email and wait for them to complete their forms. The mail for each assignee should send at the same time and the subprocess should wait all of the forms to be fullfiled before continuing the executions. That would be accomplished by having a parallel execution of the tasks in the subprocess

### Subprocess definition

- Open the **BPMN** file
- Disconnect the **end event** of the **logical gateway**
- From **Structural** grab a **Sub process** and place it in the diagram field
- Connect the end of the **logical gateway** to the **subprocess**
- Connect the **subprocess** to the **end event**

![subprocess definition](../../../../images/2025-05-12-onboarding-process-subprocess/subprocess.gif)

### Subprocess configuration

To make the subprocess execution parallel there needs to be a variable holding the employees fow which we want the services in the subprocess to execute. The subprocess esentially iterates this array variable. We've created this variable in the **Manager Review form**, so it's already in the execution context.

- Click on the subprocess
- In the **Id** field type **`onboarding-tasks-implementation`**
- In the **Name** field type **`Onboarding Tasks Implementation`**
- In the **Multi-instance type** field choose **`Parallel`**
- In the **Collection (Multi-instance)** field type **$`{TaskAssignees}`**
- In the **Element variable (Multi-instance)** field type **$`task`**. This will be the current element of the array in the iteration.

![subprocess configuration](../../../../images/2025-05-12-onboarding-process-subprocess/subprocess-configuration.gif)

### Subprocess tasks

There needs to be a service task to send emails to the assignees and a user task to wait for it's coresponding form to be fullfiled.

- Add a **start event** to the **subprocess**
- Add a **service task** and connect the **start event** to it
- Add a **user task** and connect the **service task** to it
- Add an **end event** and connect the **user task** to it

## Notifying Assignees

### Service task configuration

-	Click on the service task in the subprocess to open its properties
-	In the **Id** field type **`task-assignee-announcement`**
-	In the **Name** field type **`Task Assignee Announcement`**
-	In the **Delegate Expression** field type **`${JSTask}`**
-	Click on the **Class** field â†’ the **+** button to add handler entry
-	In the **Name** field type **`handler`**
-	In the **String value** field type the link to the task definition **`codbex-sample-hyperion-employee-onboarding/tasks/task-assignee-announcement.ts`**

![task assignee announcement service](../../../../images/2025-05-12-onboarding-process-subprocess/task-assignee-announcement.gif)

### Service task definition

- In the tasks folder create a file called **`task-assignee-announcement.ts`**
- Paste the following code in the file

const employeeDao = new EmployeeDao();
const departmentDao = new DepartmentDao();

const execution = process.getExecutionContext();
const executionId = execution.getId();
const processInstanceId = execution.getProcessInstanceId();

const task = process.getVariable(executionId, "task");
const employeeId = process.getVariable(executionId, "Employee");

const newHire = employeeDao.findById(employeeId);

> This script sends a notification email to an employee when they are
> assigned a new onboarding task related to a recently hired colleague. It  
> retrieves the task, new hire, and assignee details from the BPM process
> and the database, constructs a professional HTML email containing task 
> information and a direct link to the task page, and sends it using a mail

## Assignee User Task

To not create a separate **form** for each assignee a single **form** and **user task** will be used.

### User task configuration

-	In the **Id** field type **`generic-user-task`**
-	In the **Name** field type **`Generic User Task`**

![assignee user task configuration](../../../../images/2025-05-12-onboarding-process-subprocess/assignee-user-task-configuration.gif)

### Assignee form

1. Inside the **`forms`** folder, create another folder named **`TaskCompletion`**.

2. Within the **`forms`** folder, create a new file named **`task-completion-form.html`** and place the required code inside it.

4. Inside the `forms` folder, create a new folder named **`api`**, then create a file called **`TaskCompletionFormService.ts`** within it. Place the following code inside this file

## Test BPMN Process

- Go to the **Dashboard** of the application at http://localhost/services/web/dashboard/ â†’ Click the **New Hire Navigation**
- Enter the details of the new hire
- After some time the tasks of the onboarding process will be created. To view them go to the **Dashboard** of the application at http://localhost/services/web/dashboard/ â†’ Click the **Onboarding Tasks Navigation**
- Check the email of the manager and click on the button from there
- If you check the **Process Workspace** you'll see that the process has stop at the user task and waits for it to be completed
- After that complete the **form** by assigning employees to the tasks.
- All the employees should recieve an email

![assignee email](../../../../images/2025-05-12-onboarding-process-subprocess/assignee-email.png)

- If you check the **Process Workspace** you'll see that the process has stop at the subprocess

![subprocess waiting](../../../../images/2025-05-12-onboarding-process-subprocess/subprocess-waiting.png)

- Now click on the button from a mail send to an assignee to open the form and complete the task
