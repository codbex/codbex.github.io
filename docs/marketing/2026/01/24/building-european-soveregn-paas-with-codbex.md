As Europe accelerates its push for digital sovereignty, enterprises are rethinking their dependence on hyperscalers and non-European platforms. The goal is clear: regain control over data, infrastructure, and innovation - without sacrificing developer productivity or enterprise-grade capabilities. This is where **codbex** steps in.

We enable enterprises to build a fully capable private Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) on top of sovereign European Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) providers. By combining cloud-native abstractions with deep enterprise integration, **codbex** delivers the benefits of modern PaaS - while keeping data, workloads, and governance firmly within Europe.

## Enterprise PaaS, Without Compromise

Unlike generic container platforms or developer tools, **codbex** is designed as a complete application platform:

- **Application development and runtime** (Java, JavaScript, APIs, events)
- **Workflow and process automation** (BPMN-based, enterprise-ready)
- **Integrated data services** and analytics
- **Built-in security**, identity, and lifecycle management
- **Multi-tenant** and self-service capabilities for internal teams

All of this runs on sovereign European IaaS - such as EU-based cloud providers and on-premise infrastructure - ensuring compliance with GDPR, data residency requirements, and sector-specific regulations.

## Enterprise - Ready Benefits

By leveraging **codbex**, organizations can:

- **Model**, **generate**, and **iterate** applications rapidly with visual design tooling.
- **Automate processes** intelligently and integrate them with domain models.
- Create seamless, responsive **user experiences** with low-code UI builders.
- **Connect systems** and data via built-in integration services.
- **Extend the platform** with pro-code capabilities for custom business logic and integrations.

## What You Get Out of the Box

The product suite by codbex delivers modular, enterprise-ready building blocks that accelerate development, integration, and operations - all with a sovereign, customizable foundation.

## Sovereignty by Design

**codbex** is not a wrapper around foreign hyperscaler services. It is an open, standards-based platform built on decades of enterprise software engineering, enabling:

- Full control over deployment, upgrades, and operations
- Independence from vendor lock-in
- Transparency at the infrastructure, platform, and application layers

This makes **codbex** a strong foundation for governments, regulated industries, and large enterprises seeking long-term strategic autonomy.

## Suitability for Public Sector and Regulated Environments

**codbex** is designed to meet the structural, regulatory, and operational requirements of public-sector organizations and regulated industries within the European Union. The platform enables public institutions to build and operate a sovereign, secure, and future-proof Private PaaS while maintaining full control over data, infrastructure, and governance.

## Strategic Partnerships

**codbex** is not positioned as a standalone technology vendor, but as a strategic platform partner embedded in the European enterprise and cloud ecosystem. Our partnerships reinforce our commitment to sovereignty, interoperability, and long-term enterprise viability.

### Open Telekom Cloud (OTC)

**codbex** is strategically aligned with Open Telekom Cloud (OTC) as a leading sovereign IaaS provider in Europe. OTC offers:

- Full data residency within the EU
- Compliance with European regulations and public-sector requirements
- Transparent operations under European jurisdiction

By running **codbex** on OTC, enterprises can build a fully sovereign private PaaS that combines modern cloud-native capabilities with trusted European infrastructure - without reliance on non-EU hyperscalers.

### SAP Ecosystem and Enterprise Systems

**codbex** has deep roots in the SAP ecosystem, with technology and expertise originating from decades of SAP enterprise platform development. As a result, codbex is a natural choice for organizations looking to:

- Modernize SAP landscapes
- Migrate from SAP BW or SAP HANA to open and cloud-native architectures
- Integrate SAP ERP and S/4HANA with modern data platforms and workflows

**codbex** acts as a bridge between SAP and the open cloud world, enabling gradual transformation without disruptive rewrites.

## Open Standards and Technology Partners

Beyond OTC and SAP, **codbex** is built around open standards and widely adopted technologies, ensuring interoperability and long-term freedom of choice:

- Kubernetes and container-native runtimes
- BPMN, CMIS, SQL, REST, and event-driven architectures
- Integration with modern data platforms, analytics tools, and CI/CD pipelines

This partner-first approach allows enterprises to compose their own sovereign platform stack - aligned with internal policies, industry regulations, and strategic goals.

## Make Europe Great Again - Digitally

Europe’s competitiveness depends on its ability to innovate on its own terms. With **codbex**, organizations can build modern, scalable, and secure platforms - made in Europe, running in Europe, and governed by European values.

__Private PaaS on sovereign IaaS is no longer a trade-off. With codbex, it is a strategic advantage__.
