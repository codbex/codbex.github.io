The **codbex platform** is a full-stack, open-source, cloud-native application and automation platform built for mission-critical enterprise workloads. It combines BPM, low-code development, integration, AI automation, and data processing into a **single unified offering**, eliminating the need for fragmented multi-product stacks.

## Core BPM Features (Enterprise Standard)

- **BPMN 2.0-compliant process modeling** for standardized decision and workflow design.  
- **Model-to-execution pipeline** enabling direct execution without manual translation.  
- **Human Task Management**, including assignments, SLAs, escalation rules, and work queues.  
- **Workflow Orchestration** across systems, APIs, databases, and AI agents.  
- **Versioning and lifecycle management** with controlled deployments.  
- **Process monitoring dashboards** with audit trails, KPIs, throughput times, and bottleneck detection.  
- **Event-driven orchestration** triggered by business events, Snowflake events, timers, or external signals.

### *Unique BPM Capabilities*
- *Unified BPM + App Engine + Integration + AI agents in one stack.*  
- *Eliminates the need for Camunda + MuleSoft + custom apps + AI orchestration tools.*

## Low-Code / No-Code Development Environment

### Core Low-Code Features
- Visual editors for data models, services, UI forms, workflows, and APIs.  
- Reusable components and business objects for consistency and governance.  
- Domain-driven design tools for structuring business capabilities.  
- Wizard-driven integrations, expression editors, and built-in validators.  
- Component libraries for forms, tables, dashboards, and layouts.

### *Unique Low-Code Capabilities*
- *Low-code generates readable, open-source JavaScript/TypeScript code — zero vendor lock-in.*  
- *Extensions run as distributed container workloads for high performance.*

## Enterprise Integration Layer

### Core Integration Features
- Connectors: REST, SOAP, JDBC, SFTP, Kafka, MQ, SAP, and more.  
- Transformation pipelines for JSON, XML, CSV, IDoc structures.  
- Enterprise messaging patterns (pub/sub, request/reply, DLQ).  
- Built-in API gateway: rate limiting, OAuth2, JWT, mTLS.

### *Unique Integration Capabilities*
- *Direct integration with enterprise legacy systems while keeping compute and state in the core platform — no data duplication or shadow IT.*

## Data Services & Embedded Analytics

### Core Analytical Features
- Real-time operational dashboards with SLA compliance metrics.  
- Embedded reporting for transactional and process insights.  
- Full lineage tracking across workflow steps.  
- Insight-to-action triggers that launch remediation workflows.

### *Unique Analytical Capabilities*
- *Analytics run directly within the customer environment using native compute.*  
- *Unified data fabric for processing + analytics — avoids extra ETL pipelines.*

## AI Agent Automation & Intelligent Workflows

### Core AI Features
- AI-assisted decision-making via embedded LLMs in BPM tasks.  
- Classification, summarization, and extraction steps as workflow building blocks.  
- Multi-step **AI agent automation** for KYC, reconciliation, compliance checks, etc.  
- Prompt templates and guardrail mechanisms as reusable artifacts.

### *Unique AI Capabilities*
- *AI agents combine data, APIs, and logic into self-optimizing workflows.*  
- *Hybrid human+AI task orchestration with confidence scoring and fallback paths.*

## Open Standards & Open Source

### Core Standards
- BPMN 2.0, OpenAPI, JSON Schema, OAuth2, OIDC, REST  
- Git-native development with full CI/CD  
- Open-source-based, non-proprietary runtime

### *Unique Openness*
- *100% open-source stack — no black-box engines.*  
- *Runs fully inside the customer environment.*

## Security, Identity & Governance

### Core Security Features
- RBAC / ABAC for all artifacts and runtime components.  
- Step-level audit trails for workflows and tasks (SOX, PSD2, EBA-compliant).  
- Encryption in transit and at rest.  
- Secrets management, key rotation, DLP-compatible workflows.

### *Unique Governance Capabilities*
- *Zero-trust architecture enforced through infrastructure-provider-native controls.*  
- *Process logic, data access, and compute all governed by role-based authorization.*
