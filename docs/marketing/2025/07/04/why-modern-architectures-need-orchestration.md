# Why Modern Architectures Need Orchestration

## Chaos in the Cloud-Native World

Today‚Äôs cloud-native systems are often built on **microservices** and **serverless** paradigms, promising flexibility, scalability, and faster development cycles. These systems are inherently **distributed**, often running REST APIs, serverless functions like AWS Lambda, data pipelines via Apache Airflow, or integration flows using Apache Camel ‚Äî all operating independently, often across multiple clouds.

However, as systems grow, **managing how all these pieces interact becomes the real bottleneck**:

- How do you **coordinate** dozens or hundreds of services?
- How do you **monitor**, **govern**, and **recover** from partial failures?
- How do you provide **transparency** to technical and non-technical stakeholders?
- How do you ensure **auditability** in regulated environments?

Without orchestration, what starts as agility turns into **spaghetti logic**, **invisible dependencies**, and **escalating operational costs**.

## How Teams Try to Solve It?

Different teams use different tactics to solve orchestration challenges, often with mixed results:

### 1. Code-Based Orchestration

Using application logic to call other services ‚Äî often through HTTP, message queues, or SDKs ‚Äî embedded directly into microservices.

- ‚úÖ Simple to start  
- ‚ùå Hard to debug  
- ‚ùå No transparency or reuse  
- ‚ùå Tight coupling between services

</div>


### 2. Event-Driven Choreography

Services react to events in a loosely coupled way ‚Äî often through systems like Kafka, SNS/SQS, or Pub/Sub.

- ‚úÖ Decoupled and scalable  
- ‚ùå Complex error handling  
- ‚ùå Hard to trace workflows  
- ‚ùå No central visibility

### 3. Task-Specific Workflow Tools

Using systems like Airflow, Step Functions, or Argo for individual use cases (data pipelines, job scheduling, etc.).

- ‚úÖ Great for specific domains  
- ‚ùå Poor at cross-domain coordination  
- ‚ùå No unified governance layer

These approaches work ‚Äî until they don‚Äôt. As complexity increases, teams need something more holistic.

## Our Solution - BPMN-Based Process Orchestration for Everything

We offer a **process management layer built on BPMN v2**, tailored for the needs of **modern, cloud-native** and **data-driven** architectures. Think of it as the missing control plane for your microservices and serverless landscape.

<img src="/images/2025-07-04-why-modern-architectures-need-orchestration/orchestration-layer.png" width="800em">

Our platform allows you to **define, orchestrate, monitor, and govern** distributed tasks ‚Äî regardless of what technology stack they use.

### What You Can Orchestrate with Hyperion:

| Task Type                | Supported Examples                                 |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| REST API calls           | External/internal microservices                    |
| Serverless functions     | AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions|
| Database procedures      | Stored procedures in Snowflake, PostgreSQL, etc.  |
| Integration flows        | Apache Camel routes, SAP integrations              |
| Data pipelines           | Apache Airflow DAGs                                |
| ELT/ETL operations       | Custom data flows in hybrid or multi-cloud         |

All of these can be orchestrated as **reusable process models**, fully visible in a graphical designer and executable in our runtime.

### What Makes It Different

- ‚úÖ **Open Standard**: BPMN v2-compatible, no lock-in  
- ‚úÖ **Decoupled Execution**: Runs independently of the services it controls  
- ‚úÖ **Governance & Compliance**: Audit trails, checkpoints, versioning  
- ‚úÖ **Monitoring & Transparency**: See what‚Äôs running, where it failed, and why  
- ‚úÖ **Composable Architecture**: Easily plug in new systems or endpoints  

## Built-In Development Tools for Enterprise-Grade Delivery

The **codbex** platform includes a **built-in browser-based IDE** to support the full development lifecycle ‚Äî from modeling to deployment. 

### Key Features:

- **Integrated BPMN Designer**: Visualize, design, and test your workflows
- **Git Integration**: Enterprise-grade version control with support for GitOps
- **Centralized Development Workspace**: One place for your **processes**, **integrations**, **dataflows**, **connectors**, and **services**
- **Enterprise Readiness**: Designed to meet the needs of regulated industries and large organizations with complex delivery pipelines

This makes it easy for developers, architects, and business analysts to **collaborate**, **iterate**, and **ship faster**, without compromising governance or quality.

## Native Observability with OpenTelemetry

At runtime, the **BPMN engine** and all other execution components offer native **OpenTelemetry integration**.

- Seamless compatibility with **cloud-native monitoring stacks** (e.g., AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, Google Cloud Operations)
- Unified tracing and metrics across distributed systems
- Alerting and logging hooks for real-time insight

This ensures **end-to-end observability**, making it easy to **monitor**, **trace**, and **debug** any process ‚Äî no matter where it's running.

## Real-World Architecture: From Backend to Data Stack

</div>

Our orchestration layer can be embedded into **any cloud-native stack**, and is especially powerful in:

- **Microservices Governance**: Centralize control over service flows, timeouts, retries, and human approvals  
- **Data Platform Orchestration**: Combine **Snowflake**, and **Airflow** into unified data workflows  
- **Integration Hubs**: Manage complex SAP, REST, and file-based integrations using Apache Camel as building blocks  

We don‚Äôt replace your services ‚Äî we coordinate them.

## Available Where You Need It Most

- üåê **Snowflake-native integration** ‚Äî enabling advanced orchestration inside data platforms  
- üá™üá∫ **Open Telekom Cloud** ‚Äî for EU-based deployments and digital sovereignty  
- ‚òÅÔ∏è **All major public clouds** ‚Äî AWS, Azure, GCP, and hybrid scenarios
