## Connection Configurations

One of the key features of the Hades Edition is its support for relational as well as NoSQL databases. Hades simplifies the process of configuring a database, allowing users to easily set up connections and manage database settings. Along with the popular databases such as PostgeSQL, MySQL, H2 and MongoDB, it also supports the commercial databases like SAP HANA, Snowflake and Amazon Aurora and DocumentDB.

## Database Explorer

With the Database Explorer feature, users can navigate through the structure of their databases, view tables, columns, and relationships. Hades provides an intuitive interface for exploring the database schema, making it easier to understand and work with the data.

## SQL View

The SQL View feature enables users to write and execute SQL queries directly from the web interface. This powerful tool allows for efficient data retrieval and manipulation.

## Results View

Once a query is executed, the Results View displays the retrieved data in a tabular format. Users can easily analyze and manipulate the results, making it convenient for data analysis and reporting purposes.

## Anonymization

Data privacy and security are crucial considerations in today's digital landscape.

## Deployment

#### Containerization

First, you need to containerize the Hades application. This involves packaging it into a container image using technologies like Docker. Containerization allows for easy deployment and management of the application across different environments.

#### Cloud Selection

Choose the public or private cloud provider where you want to deploy Hades. Popular options include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and private cloud solutions like OpenStack.

#### Container Orchestration

To efficiently manage and scale your containerized application, you can use a container orchestration platform like Kubernetes. Kubernetes provides features for deploying, scaling, and managing containers across a cluster of machines.

#### Deployment Configuration

Configure the deployment settings for Hades, such as resource allocation, networking, and storage requirements. This can be done using configuration files or through the cloud provider's management console.

#### Deployment Process

Use the chosen cloud provider's tools or command-line interface to deploy the containerized Hades application. This involves specifying the container image, defining the desired number of replicas, and setting up any necessary networking and storage resources.

#### Integration with Other Workloads

If you have other application workloads running on the same cloud environment, you can integrate Hades with them. This can be done by configuring networking and communication between the different containers or services.

> Remember to follow best practices for security, scalability, and monitoring when deploying Hades or any other application workload on a public or private cloud. Each cloud provider may have specific guidelines and documentation to help you with the deployment process.
