# jPrime 2024 - Innovation, Community, and Open Source

## Gold Sponsorship and Our Mission

This year, **codbex proudly joined jPrime 2024 as a Gold Sponsor**, reinforcing our commitment to **open-source innovation and developer empowerment**. jPrime has long been a hub for Java and JVM enthusiasts, bringing together top industry experts, passionate engineers, and forward-thinking companies.  

At **our booth in the conference hall**, we had the incredible opportunity to **connect with developers, share insights about codbex**, and discuss how our open-source approach is shaping the future of business applications. It was inspiring to see so much enthusiasm for building powerful, scalable, and developer-friendly software solutions.

## Engaging with the Community

Beyond sponsorship, our presence at jPrime 2024 was about engagement and collaboration. We spoke with countless participants about **our mission**, the **codbex technology stack**, and the ways we contribute to the open-source ecosystem. From discussing **low-code development** with [codbex - Atlas](/products/atlas) to sharing ideas on **enterprise process automation**, every conversation was a chance to exchange knowledge and spark new possibilities.
