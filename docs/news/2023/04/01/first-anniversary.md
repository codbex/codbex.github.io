# First Anniversary

On April 1st, we celebrated the first anniversary of codbex!
A year ago, we started our own business based on what we believed cloud developers needed to be productive.

The first day I was alone in codbex "headquarters" (my living room at home), thinking about the hundreds of little things that need to be done in the next few days. I have to admit there was a bit of fear, but relying on the already prepared plan A (...and B and C...) I was confident we can do it. I had the full support of my family and my friends, who told me it was high time
to try to achieve what we dreamed of.

Shortly thereafter, Yordan our CTO, joined me in this endevour, and now there are a dozen of us. I call them the "Alpha Team" for a reason - top experts who can handle any challenge in the technology business.

So, we deserved a good anniversary party...

The first year was tough, but we enjoyed every single moment, preparing for the next hundred.

Good luck!
