**HackTUES 11 – Empowering Young Innovators**

At codbex, we believe in the power of innovation and the importance of nurturing the next generation of tech leaders. That’s why we were proud to sponsor **HackTUES 11**, the annual hackathon organized by students of TUES, where young minds come together to create, innovate, and push technological boundaries.

## Our Role at HackTUES 11

This year, codbex was actively involved in several aspects of the event:

- **Jury for the Semi-Finals** – We had the privilege of being part of the jury panel, evaluating some of the most creative and ambitious projects developed during the hackathon.
- **Mentorship** – Two of our experts, both TUES alumni, guided and supported competing teams, helping them refine their ideas and enhance their solutions.
- **Special Prize** – As part of our commitment to fostering innovation, we awarded a special prize to [Balkanskite Momi](https://github.com/Maycheto/Balkanskite_momi) for their outstanding project, recognizing their technical execution, creativity, and impact.

### HackTUES 11 Winner

A huge congratulations to [Team 443](https://github.com/dimitarNzhelev/surgery-robot) for winning **HackTUES 11** with their idea for **Tele-surgery**! Tele-surgery is an innovative platform that enables remote control and management of surgical operations, offering high security and minimal communication delay. The system includes real-time video streaming from the robot to the surgeon via a VR device, with secure communication powered by WireGuard VPN and hosted on AWS. This solution aims to revolutionize remote medical procedures, ensuring precise control and visualization.

## Looking Ahead

HackTUES is more than just a hackathon — it’s a movement that inspires and empowers the next generation of tech pioneers. We at цodbex are honored to support these bright minds and look forward to seeing where their talents take them in the future.

Stay tuned for more initiatives and collaborations as we continue to drive innovation forward!
