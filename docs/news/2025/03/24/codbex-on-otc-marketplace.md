## Seamless Service Integration & Orchestration

Our products provide ready-to-use tools for connecting cloud services, databases, and business applications. This allows enterprises to build automated workflows, ETL pipelines, and enterprise-wide integrationsâ€”directly within OTC, reducing operational complexity.

## Legacy Modernization Without Rebuilding From Scratch

For organizations still running SAP BW, SAP HANA XS Classic, and other legacy systems, **codbex** enables a smooth transition to modern cloud-native environments. Instead of rewriting applications, businesses can lift-and-shift existing workloads while unlocking new capabilities and improved performance.

## Flexible Deployment Across Multi-Cloud & On-Prem

All products run not only on OTC but also on AWS, Azure, GCP, Snowflake, and on-premise environments. This ensures that OTC customers can maintain portability and interoperability, avoiding vendor lock-in and allowing for hybrid and multi-cloud strategies.

## Enterprise-Grade Security, Scalability & Compliance

Running **codbex** solutions on OTC means benefiting from Open Telekom Cloudâ€™s highly secure and compliant infrastructure, meeting strict European data protection standards (GDPR, ISO 27001, etc.). Enterprises can scale their operations confidently while maintaining full control over their data.

## A Cost-Effective Path to Digital Transformation

By leveraging **codbexâ€™s** open-source, cloud-native approach, businesses can reduce licensing costs, minimize migration efforts, and accelerate digital transformationâ€”all while taking advantage of OTCâ€™s competitive pricing model.

With **codbex** now available on OTC Marketplace, enterprises can achieve faster innovation, greater efficiency, and future-proof modernizationâ€”without disruption.
