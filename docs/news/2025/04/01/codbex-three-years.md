# We Turn Three: A Journey of Stability, Growth, and Innovation

As we celebrate __codbex__’s third anniversary, we take a moment to reflect on how far we’ve come—and more importantly, where we’re going. What began as a focused initiative to build smart developer tools has evolved into a stable and growing technology company that is earning trust across industries and geographies.

## A Stable Foundation, a Clear Vision

In a rapidly changing tech landscape, stability is everything. Over the past three years, we’ve stayed true to our core mission: delivering high-quality, developer-centric products that solve real problems. Through disciplined execution and a clear product vision, we’ve built a solid foundation that allows us to grow without compromising on quality or customer focus.

## Investing in Product and Quality

This year, we’ve significantly increased our investment in new products, R&D, and quality assurance. Whether it's performance, security, or usability, we continue to raise the bar across our offerings. We're not just building more—we're building better.

Our engineering and product teams are more aligned than ever, guided by a strong feedback loop from customers and partners. Every feature we ship is a step toward a more productive, connected, and efficient future for the developer community.

## Expanding Our Reach: Snowflake, AWS & OTC Marketplaces

We’re proud to be present in key cloud marketplaces, including:

* Snowflake Marketplace: Delivering ready-to-integrate data applications and analytics extensions.
* AWS Marketplace: Offering scalable, secure solutions that work seamlessly in modern cloud environments.
* OTC Marketplace: Reaching enterprise customers through a trusted ecosystem of business services.

These platforms have given us a broader reach and enabled customers to integrate our solutions into their existing cloud infrastructures with confidence.

## Partnering with Purpose

We believe in the power of strategic, focused partnerships. That’s why we’re working closely with a select group of customers and partners on impactful projects—from digital transformation in supply chains to cloud-native architecture adoption. These collaborations go beyond technology—they’re about building trust, sharing knowledge, and delivering measurable outcomes.

## Supporting Our Local Tech Ecosystem

Our company has always been rooted in community. This year, we stepped up our support for the local tech ecosystem by sponsoring events, hackathons, and developer meetups. We believe in giving back, and we’re proud to be playing an active role in fostering innovation and growth in our region.

## Looking Ahead

As we enter our fourth year, we’re more excited than ever about what’s ahead. We’ll continue to:

* Launch new products that simplify and accelerate development.
* Strengthen our marketplace presence.
* Scale our partnerships.
* Deepen our commitment to quality and customer success.

To our customers, partners, and team—thank you for believing in us. You’ve helped shape __codbex__ into the company it is today, and we’re just getting started.
