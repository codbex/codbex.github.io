# Introducing the New Pricing Model

**Posted on July 1st, 2025**

As the sun rose on this **July Morning**, we marked more than just the beginning of a new month — it’s the beginning of a more flexible, transparent, and future-ready way to build, integrate, and operate with **codbex**.

We’re excited to unveil our **new pricing model**, designed to make it easier than ever to use the **codbex** platform for modern applications, business processes, and data-driven integrations. Whether you're modeling workflows, managing content, designing services, or deploying end-to-end low-code solutions — we’ve got a plan that fits.

## Why We Reimagined Pricing

Over time, many teams told us the same thing: while our technology fits modern development, our pricing didn’t fully match the way modern teams operate. Usage-based pricing models — tied to flows, users, or invisible metrics — often lead to uncertainty, especially when working across cloud, hybrid, and sovereign environments.

That’s why we’ve rethought everything. Our new pricing is **flat-rate, predictable, and aligned with how teams actually work**. You pay for the level of support and engagement you need — and build without constraint.

## What’s Included?

### **Starter Plan — $249/month**
Perfect for small teams or new projects. Includes full platform access, community-driven support, and self-service setup.

### **Professional Plan — $999/month**
Tailored for active development teams building and deploying cloud-native apps, workflows, and integrations. Includes GitHub source control setup, CI/CD automation, cloud deployment assistance, and 2-business-day email support.

### **Enterprise Plan — $2,999/month**
Built for organizations with mission-critical workloads and complex integration needs. Includes success engineering, premium SLAs, advanced infrastructure support, and direct access to the **codbex** product team.

### **Community Access — Free**
Use open-source components, access platform documentation, and collaborate with others in the **codbex** community. No license or cost required.

## Designed for Real Teams

We help you turn ideas into running systems — fast. Whether you're a developer, an architect, or a process owner, the platform supports **low-code modeling, process orchestration, JavaScript-based service logic, content management**, and **integration flows** — all in one environment. Your current team can get started right away, without costly retraining or proprietary lock-in.

## A New Morning for Builders

Like the spirit of *“July Morning”*, this is a fresh start — one shaped by feedback, experience, and long-term vision. We’ve built this pricing to be sustainable, fair, and scalable — helping you confidently evolve your digital systems without worrying about pricing surprises or limitations.
