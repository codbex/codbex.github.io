If we decide to make changes to this Privacy Policy, we will post a revised Privacy Policy so that you will always know what information we collect, and how we use it. You should check this Privacy Policy regularly so you are aware of the latest version. From time to time, as may be required by applicable law, we may also seek your explicit consent to process certain data and information collected on the CODBEX Platform or volunteered by you.

If there are any terms in this privacy policy that you don’t agree with please discontinue use of our site and our services.

### COLLECTION AND PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA

#### _What data do we collect?_

1. Email addresses.

  The only personal data we collect from you is your email address. We collect this information when you voluntarily provide it to us, such as when you sign up or contact us via email.

2. Cookies. How to manage cookies?

  We use third-party cookies like but not limited to Google Analytics, Twitter and YouTube, to collect information about how you interact with our website. This information is anonymous and cannot be used to identify you personally. We use this data to improve our website's performance and user experience. You can manage your cookies preferences at any time, by clicking on “Manage Cookies” on our website.

#### _How do we store your data?_

At CODBEX, we understand that data is a critical asset for any business, and keeping it secure is of utmost importance. We take our responsibility to protect your data very seriously, and we use state-of-the-art technology to ensure that your information is stored safely and securely.

One of the ways we store your data is through the use of the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). GCP is a secure cloud environment that offers a range of features designed to keep your data safe. Here's how we store your data using GCP:

**Encryption:** We use encryption to ensure that your data is secure both when it's in transit and at rest. GCP uses strong encryption standards, including 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption, to ensure that your data is always protected.

**Data Segregation:** We make sure that your data is segregated from other customers' data. This means that your data is stored separately and cannot be accessed or tampered with by anyone else.

**Multi-Factor Authentication:** We use multi-factor authentication to ensure that only authorised personnel can access your data. This means that we require more than just a password to access your data - we also use additional factors, such as biometric information or a token, to verify identity.

**Firewalls:** We use firewalls to protect your data from unauthorised access. Our firewalls act as a barrier between the internet and your data, blocking any attempts to access it that do not meet our strict security protocols.

**Regular Backups:** We regularly back up your data to ensure that it can be restored in the event of a disaster or data loss. Our backups are stored in a separate location, ensuring that even if there is a failure in one location, your data will still be safe.

At CODBEX we use the latest technology to ensure that your data is stored safely and securely. By using GCP, we can provide a secure cloud environment that gives you peace of mind knowing that your data is protected at all times.


#### _Will your data be shared with anyone?_

We do not share your personal data with others outside of CODBEX. We do not disclose your personal data to any third parties, except for our trusted service providers who assist us in operating our website and providing services to you. These service providers are contractually obligated to keep your personal data confidential and secure.

### USE AND PURPOSE OF COLLECTED PERSONAL DATA

We will use the collected personal data only as described in this Privacy Policy and/or in the way we specify at the time of collection. We will not subsequently change the way your personal data is used without your consent, as required by applicable law. Some of the ways we may use your personal data include, but are not limited to:

- Provide the ability to create personal profile areas and view protected content.
- Conduct online chat or email communications.
- Provide the ability to contact you and to provide customer feedback and support.
